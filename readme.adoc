= Hobby-Auth

This repository provides a https://github.com/ch1c0t/hobby[Hobby] extension
to authorize routes.

== Installation

[source,bash]
----
gem install hobby-auth
----

== Introduction

You are expected to pass your user models as arguments to `Hobby::Auth.[]`:

[source,ruby]
----
require 'hobby'
require 'hobby/auth'

class YourApp
  include Hobby
  include Auth[*array_of_user_models]

  # some route defining logic goes here, after 'includes'
end
----

A user model is any object that responds to `.find_by_token` method
which takes one argument(a token)
and returns `nil`(if no user were found)
or a user(which can be any object you would like to consider a user in your application).

You can access that user via `user` method.

Consider an example app where you need two user roles: managers and drivers.
You can define `Manager` class as follows:

[source,ruby]
----
class Manager
  def self.find_by_token token
    new if token == 'the only valid token at the moment'
  end
end
----
and `Driver` class similarly.

Then, you can use them in your app:

[source,ruby]
----
class App
  include Hobby
  include Auth[Manager, Driver]

  manager post('/managers_route') {
    # do something only managers can do
    user # will return a `Manager` instance
  }

  driver get('/drivers_route') {
    # do something only drivers can do
    user # will return a `Driver` instance
  }
end
----

The token is expected to be passed via
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Authorization[Authorization header].
If no user were found, the response's status will be set to
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/403[403].

== Development

To run the specs:

[source,bash]
----
bundle exec rspec
----

To perform mutation analysis:
